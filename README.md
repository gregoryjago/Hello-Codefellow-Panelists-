Hello-Codefellow-Panelists-
===========================

When presented with your request for my github and linkedin profiles, I had a few options on how to proceed, since I didn't have an active github already. I could throw together some code this morning that would be bug ridden, unstable, and sloppy. Or, I could copy some unrelated code from something else and hope that it was up to snuff. 

I decided to go with option 3. Honest representation. 

I have just started working in the github environment, and am not that comfortable here...yet. That will change, but for now...here is my account, stay tuned, because I'm going to start rocking it here (with your help, I hope). You'll just have to take my word for it.
